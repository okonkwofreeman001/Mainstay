# Mainstay Deployment Runbook

This guide covers the deployment and initialization of Mainstay contracts on Stellar networks (Testnet, Mainnet).

Note: `scripts/deploy_testnet.sh` hard-requires `STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet` (from `.env`) and explicitly passes `--network testnet` to all Stellar CLI calls to prevent accidentally deploying to the wrong network.

## Prerequisites
- Stellar CLI installed and configured.
- A functional identity (`deployer`) with enough lumens.

## 0. Formal Security Audit Requirement

Mainstay handles real industrial asset records used as DeFi collateral. A formal Soroban security audit is **required** before Mainnet deployment.

### 0.1 Audit Firm Selection

The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) maintains the **Soroban Security Audit Bank**, a curated list of pre-approved audit firms. SCF-funded projects may qualify for subsidized audits.

**Recommended firms** (see `docs/audit-report.md` for full details):

| Firm | Soroban Expertise | Key Credential |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **Veridise** | Audited Soroban Core | Proprietary AuditHub tooling; deepest Soroban experience |
| **Halborn** | Enterprise-grade assessments | Audited Soroban zkCrossDex |
| **Hacken** | Bridge accounting; trust boundaries | Audited Soroban intent bridges |
| **Certora** | Formal verification | Mathematical correctness proofs |

### Pre-Audit Checklist
- [ ] Finalize and freeze the contract codebase (tag a release candidate).
- [ ] Run full test suite with coverage: `./scripts/test.sh`.
- [ ] Run `cargo clippy` with all lints and resolve warnings.
- [ ] Run `cargo audit` to check dependency vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Complete internal threat modeling (STRIDE framework).
- [ ] Verify deployment runbook initialization on testnet.

### Required Actions
- Engage a Soroban-specialized audit firm (see `docs/audit-report.md` §Recommended Audit Firms).
- Address all audit findings before mainnet deployment.
- Publish the final audit report in `docs/audit-report.md`.
- Complete this deployment checklist after the audit is finished.

## 1. Build Contracts
Compile all contracts to optimized WASM:
```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

## 2. Deploy & Bind Registries
Deploy contracts in order and store their IDs.

### 2.1 Asset Registry
```bash
stellar contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/asset_registry.wasm --network testnet --source deployer
```
*Note the Asset Registry ID (AR_ID).*

### 2.2 Engineer Registry
```bash
stellar contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/engineer_registry.wasm --network testnet --source deployer
```
*Note the Engineer Registry ID (ER_ID).*

### 2.3 Lifecycle Contract
```bash
stellar contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/lifecycle.wasm --network testnet --source deployer
```
*Note the Lifecycle Contract ID (LC_ID).*

### 2.4 Lending Contract
```bash
stellar contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/lending.wasm --network testnet --source deployer
```
*Note the Lending Contract ID (LN_ID).*

## 3. Initialization & TTL Setup

> **Security: deployer-only initialization**
> Each `initialize_admin` / `initialize` call now requires the `deployer` argument to sign the
> transaction. The `--source deployer` flag on the Stellar CLI satisfies this requirement.
> **Complete all four initialization steps in the same block as deployment** (or immediately
> after) to eliminate the window in which an observer could front-run initialization with their
> own address.

### 3.1 Initialize Asset Registry Admin
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id AR_ID --network testnet --source deployer -- initialize_admin \
  --deployer <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS>
```

### 3.2 Initialize Engineer Registry Admin
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id ER_ID --network testnet --source deployer -- initialize_admin \
  --deployer <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS>
```

### 3.3 Initialize Lifecycle Binding
Connect Lifecycle to AR and ER:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id LC_ID --network testnet --source deployer -- initialize \
  --deployer <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> \
  --asset_registry AR_ID \
  --engineer_registry ER_ID \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --max_history 200
```

> **Security (#1254): `asset_registry` and `engineer_registry` must be distinct addresses.**
> The lifecycle `initialize` function validates that `AR_ID` ≠ `ER_ID`. Passing the same
> contract address for both registries is rejected with `ContractError::SameRegistryAddress`
> (error code 13). This prevents a class of misconfiguration where cross-contract calls to
> asset and engineer registries would silently resolve to the same contract, returning
> semantically incorrect data.
>
> If this error is returned during initialization, verify that you are passing the correct
> Asset Registry ID and Engineer Registry ID — they must be the IDs of two different deployed
> contracts.

### 3.4 Initialize Lending Contract
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id LN_ID --network testnet --source deployer -- initialize \
  --deployer <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --token <TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
  --yield_bps 500 \
  --slash_bps 1000
```

## 4. Post-Deployment Verification
Once initialized, verify the contract state and availability.

### 4.1 Verify Asset Registry
Confirm the registry is responsive and the admin is correctly set:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id AR_ID --network testnet --source any -- get_admin
```

### 4.2 Verify Engineer Registry
Confirm the registry is responsive and the admin is correctly set:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id ER_ID --network testnet --source any -- get_admin
```

### 4.3 Verify Lifecycle Binding
Confirm that Lifecycle can reach the Asset Registry (this triggers a cross-contract call):
```bash
# Attempt to get a non-existent asset; should return a contract error (not a panic)
stellar contract invoke --id LC_ID --network testnet --source any -- get_collateral_score --asset_id 999
```

### 4.4 Verify Lending Contract
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id LN_ID --network testnet --source any -- get_config
```

### 4.5 Post-Deploy Configuration: `max_submissions_per_hour`

The Lifecycle contract enforces a per-engineer rate limit on `submit_maintenance` calls via the `max_submissions_per_hour` config field. **`0` disables rate limiting entirely** — every submission is accepted regardless of frequency. The stock initializer sets this to a conservative default (`DEFAULT_MAX_SUBMISSIONS_PER_HOUR = 20`), but any operator who has customized initialization, restored config from a template, or called `update_max_submissions_per_hour` with `0` while testing should not assume rate limiting is active. **Always explicitly confirm and set this value as part of post-deploy configuration — do not rely on the default silently being correct for your deployment.**

#### Setting the value
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id LC_ID --network testnet --source deployer -- \
  update_max_submissions_per_hour --admin ADMIN_ADDRESS --new_max 30
```

#### Recommended values by fleet size

| Expected fleet size (active engineers) | Recommended `max_submissions_per_hour` | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Small (< 10 engineers, pilot/testnet) | 10–15 | Tight cap; easy to spot anomalous submission bursts during early rollout |
| Medium (10–100 engineers) | 20–30 | Matches contract default; covers routine multi-asset maintenance days without throttling legitimate work |
| Large (100–1,000 engineers) | 40–60 | Higher ceiling for engineers servicing multiple assets per shift; pair with off-chain alerting on sustained near-cap usage |
| Very large / fleet-management integrators (1,000+ engineers, automated IoT-triggered submissions) | 60–100, or per-engineer overrides if supported | High-volume automated submission flows need headroom; monitor `MAINT` event rate per engineer address to tune further |

These are starting points, not hard rules — tune based on observed submission patterns from `MAINT` event volume (see [Section 5.1](#51-event-monitoring)) during the first weeks of operation.

#### Verifying rate limiting is active
After configuring the value, confirm it took effect and is actually enforced:

```bash
# 1. Confirm the configured value is non-zero
stellar contract invoke --id LC_ID --network testnet --source any -- get_config
# Inspect the returned config struct's max_submissions_per_hour field — it must not be 0.

# 2. Confirm the per-engineer eligibility check reflects the configured cap
stellar contract invoke --id LC_ID --network testnet --source any -- \
  check_engineer_submission_rate --engineer ENGINEER_ADDRESS
# Returns true/false based on the engineer's rolling submission count vs. max_submissions_per_hour.
```

If `get_config` reports `max_submissions_per_hour: 0`, rate limiting is **off** — treat this as a deployment gap and set an appropriate value immediately using the command above before handing the contract off to operations.

## 5. Monitoring Recommendations
Mainstay contracts are critical for asset financing. Active monitoring is recommended.

### 5.1 Event Monitoring
Subscribe to contract events to track lifecycle transitions:
- `REG_AST`: Asset registration.
- `MAINT`: Maintenance record submissions.
- `DECAY`: Score decay updates.
- `DEPRECATED`: Asset deprecation.
- `XFER`: Asset transfer sentinel in Lifecycle.

### 5.2 Storage Expiration (TTL)
The project relies on **persistent storage** for all metadata and histories.

#### 5.2.1 Initial TTL Verification
Verify that the instance storage for all four contracts is extended past 30 days:
```bash
stellar contract storage extend --id LC_ID --network testnet --durability instance --ledgers-to-extend 518400
```

#### 5.2.2 Ongoing TTL Monitoring
If a contract remains inactive for long periods (near 30 days), persistent entries must be manually extended using the `stellar contract storage extend` command to prevent data loss.

Refer to [docs/ttl-strategy.md](ttl-strategy.md) for a full mapping of storage keys.

## 6. Testnet vs Mainnet Differences

### 6.1 Network Configuration

| Aspect | Testnet | Mainnet |
|---|---|---|
| `--network` flag | `testnet` | `mainnet` |
| RPC URL | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` | `https://soroban-mainnet.stellar.org` (or your own node) |
| Lumens required | Funded via Friendbot (`stellar keys fund`) | Real XLM; obtain before deployment |
| Key management | Generated key (`stellar keys generate`) | Hardware wallet or multisig key ceremony |
| Deployment script | `./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh` | No equivalent script; use the manual steps in this runbook with `--network mainnet` |

### 6.2 Pre-Mainnet Gate: Formal Security Audit

> ⚠️ **Mainnet deployment is gated by a completed formal security audit. Do NOT skip this step.**

The Mainstay system manages real industrial asset collateral that integrates with DeFi lending protocols. A vulnerability in any contract could result in:
- Loss or corruption of maintenance records
- Manipulation of collateral scores
- Unauthorized loan issuance
- Permanent data loss due to TTL expiry
- Compromise of the admin role

**Gate checklist — all items must be checked before proceeding to §6.3:**

- [ ] Audit firm selected and engaged (see §0.1 and `docs/audit-report.md` for recommendations)
- [ ] Audit kickoff completed with full documentation bundle
- [ ] All Critical-severity findings resolved and verified by the auditor
- [ ] All High-severity findings resolved and verified by the auditor
- [ ] All Medium-severity findings resolved or documented with deferral justification
- [ ] Auditor sign-off letter received and filed
- [ ] Final audit report published to `docs/audit-report.md`
- [ ] Regression tests for all resolved findings merged to `main`
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` passes with zero failures
- [ ] `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` passes with zero warnings
- [ ] `cargo audit` passes with zero high-severity advisories
- [ ] `.gitleaks.toml` scan passes with zero findings
- [ ] Threat model reviewed and updated (`docs/threat-model.md`)
- [ ] Admin multisig ceremony completed (for mainnet admin key)
- [ ] Deployer cold wallet secured
- [ ] Emergency response plan documented and distributed

### 6.3 Mainnet Build & Deploy Steps

Replace every `--network testnet` flag with `--network mainnet`. Do not use `./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh` — that script hard-rejects non-testnet networks.

```bash
# 1. Build (same as testnet)
./scripts/build.sh

# 2. Deploy Asset Registry
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/asset_registry.wasm \
  --network mainnet \
  --source deployer
# Save as AR_ID

# 3. Deploy Engineer Registry
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/engineer_registry.wasm \
  --network mainnet \
  --source deployer
# Save as ER_ID

# 4. Deploy Lifecycle (must come after AR and ER)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/lifecycle.wasm \
  --network mainnet \
  --source deployer
# Save as LC_ID

# 5. Deploy Lending
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/lending.wasm \
  --network mainnet \
  --source deployer
# Save as LN_ID
```

**Deployment order is mandatory**: Lifecycle `initialize` requires both registry contract IDs, so asset-registry and engineer-registry must be deployed and their IDs noted before lifecycle is deployed. Lending can be deployed independently.

### 6.4 Mainnet Initialization

Initialize all contracts in the **same transaction block** as deployment to eliminate front-run risk on initialization.

```bash
# Initialize Asset Registry
stellar contract invoke --id AR_ID --network mainnet --source deployer -- initialize_admin \
  --deployer <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> \
  --admin <MULTISIG_ADMIN_ADDRESS>

# Initialize Engineer Registry
stellar contract invoke --id ER_ID --network mainnet --source deployer -- initialize_admin \
  --deployer <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> \
  --admin <MULTISIG_ADMIN_ADDRESS>

# Initialize Lifecycle (bind to registries)
stellar contract invoke --id LC_ID --network mainnet --source deployer -- initialize \
  --deployer <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> \
  --asset_registry AR_ID \
  --engineer_registry ER_ID \
  --admin <MULTISIG_ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --max_history 200
# Note: AR_ID and ER_ID must be different addresses.
# Passing the same address for both will return SameRegistryAddress (error 13).

# Initialize Lending
stellar contract invoke --id LN_ID --network mainnet --source deployer -- initialize \
  --deployer <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> \
  --admin <MULTISIG_ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --token <TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
  --yield_bps 500 \
  --slash_bps 1000
```

### 6.5 Post-Deploy Verification Checklist

Run these checks immediately after initialization. Do not hand off to operations until every item is confirmed.

**Registry checks:**
- [ ] `stellar contract invoke --id AR_ID --network mainnet --source any -- get_admin` returns the expected multisig admin address.
- [ ] `stellar contract invoke --id ER_ID --network mainnet --source any -- get_admin` returns the expected multisig admin address.

**Cross-contract binding check:**
- [ ] `stellar contract invoke --id LC_ID --network mainnet --source any -- get_collateral_score --asset_id 999` returns a contract error (`AssetNotFound`), not a panic or `NotInitialized` error. A `NotInitialized` error means the binding was not saved correctly.

**Config check:**
- [ ] `stellar contract invoke --id LC_ID --network mainnet --source any -- get_config` returns `max_history: 200` and the expected admin address.

**Lending contract check:**
- [ ] `stellar contract invoke --id LN_ID --network mainnet --source any -- get_config` returns the expected configuration.

**TTL extension:**
- [ ] Extend instance storage for all four contracts immediately after initialization:
  ```bash
  for ID in AR_ID ER_ID LC_ID LN_ID; do
    stellar contract storage extend --id $ID --network mainnet --durability instance --ledgers-to-extend 518400
  done
  ```

**Smoke test (required):**
- [ ] Register one asset type and one test asset via AR_ID.
- [ ] Register one engineer via ER_ID.
- [ ] Authorize engineer for test asset.
- [ ] Submit one maintenance record via LC_ID and confirm `get_collateral_score` returns a non-zero value.
- [ ] Remove/deregister the test data if the contract supports it, or note the test asset IDs for auditing.
- [ ] Verify lending contract functions (request, check status) with test data.
- [ ] Verify pause/unpause works correctly on all four contracts.
- [ ] Verify admin timelock operations (propose + wait + execute).

### 6.6 Key Management Differences

On testnet, generated keys (`stellar keys generate`) are acceptable. On mainnet:

- Use a hardware wallet (Ledger) or a dedicated signing key stored in a secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
- The `deployer` identity should be a cold wallet used exclusively for deployment; transfer admin rights to a multisig account before handing off to operations.
- Store AR_ID, ER_ID, LC_ID, and LN_ID in a configuration management system (e.g., environment-specific `.env.mainnet`) immediately after deployment — these IDs cannot be recovered once lost without re-deployment.
- Document the multisig threshold and signer set in the emergency response plan.

### 6.7 Emergency Response

- [ ] Emergency contacts documented and accessible to all multisig signers
- [ ] Pause procedure documented and tested on testnet
- [ ] Key rotation procedure documented
- [ ] Incident response runbook created (separate document)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured for all four contracts
