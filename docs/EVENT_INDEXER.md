# Stellar Horizon Event Indexer Integration Guide

This guide provides comprehensive documentation and example code for building real-time monitoring systems that index and track Mainstay on-chain events using the Stellar Horizon API and Soroban event streams.

## Overview

The Mainstay lifecycle contract emits structured events for all critical asset operations. Off-chain systems can listen to these events to:

- **Maintain real-time dashboards** of asset health and maintenance status
- **Trigger automated workflows** (alerts, notifications, compliance checks)
- **Audit compliance** against regulatory or financing requirements
- **Build analytics** on asset maintenance patterns
- **Enable DeFi integrations** with lending platforms

Events are published via the Stellar Soroban event system and can be retrieved through Stellar Horizon or monitored in real-time via event streams.

## Event Types

The Mainstay lifecycle contract emits the following event types:

| Event Code | Name | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `INIT` | Initialize | Contract initialized with configuration |
| `REG_AST` | Register Asset | New asset registered in system |
| `REG_ENG` | Register Engineer | New engineer credentialed for maintenance |
| `MAINT` | Maintenance | Maintenance task completed |
| `XFER` | Transfer | Asset ownership transferred |
| `DECAY` | Decay | Collateral score decayed due to time passage |
| `RST_SCR` | Reset Score | Asset score manually reset by admin |
| `WEIGHT_PROP` | Weight Proposal | Proposal to change task weight submitted |
| `WEIGHT_EXEC` | Weight Executed | Proposed task weight change executed |
| `ADMIN_SET` | Admin Set | New admin assigned |
| `PROP_ADMIN` | Propose Admin | Admin change proposed (timelock) |
| `REG_STD` | Register Standard | Maintenance standard registered for asset type |
| `PRUNED` | Pruned | Historical records pruned from contract |
| `RECONSTR` | Reconstructed | History reconstructed from snapshot anchor |

## Event Structure

Each event emitted by the contract follows this pattern:

```rust
// For events with simple payloads:
env.events().publish(
    (EventCode, Asset ID or Symbol),
    Event Payload (Bytes)
);
```

### Event Schemas

#### MAINT (Maintenance Event)
Emitted when maintenance is submitted.

**Topics**: `(MAINT, asset_id)`

**Payload Structure**:
```
{
  "engineer": "GXXXXX...",           // Engineer who performed maintenance
  "timestamp": 1696900000,            // Unix timestamp
  "task_type": "ROUTINE",             // Task category
  "priority": 2,                      // Priority level (0-3)
  "score": 85,                        // Resulting score after maintenance
  "notes_hash": "0x...",              // Hash of maintenance notes
  "cost": null                        // Optional maintenance cost in stroops
}
```

#### XFER (Transfer Event)
Emitted when asset ownership is transferred.

**Topics**: `(XFER, asset_id)`

**Payload Structure**:
```
{
  "from": "GXXXXX...",                // Original owner
  "to": "GXXXXX...",                  // New owner
  "timestamp": 1696900000             // Transfer timestamp
}
```

#### DECAY (Score Decay Event)
Emitted when collateral score decays due to time.

**Topics**: `(DECAY, asset_id)`

**Payload Structure**:
```
{
  "old_score": 90,
  "new_score": 85,
  "days_elapsed": 30,
  "timestamp": 1696900000
}
```

#### REG_STD (Register Standard Event)
Emitted when maintenance standard registered for asset type.

**Topics**: `(REG_STD, asset_type)`

**Payload Structure**:
```
{
  "standard_hash": "0x...",           // Hash of standard definition
  "timestamp": 1696900000
}
```

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Horizon REST API Polling

Use Stellar Horizon API to fetch contract events after the fact.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Fetch Mainstay contract events from Horizon and index them.

    async for event in server.events().cursor("now").filter(
        {"type": "contract", "contractId": contract_id}

            topic = f"{KAFKA_TOPIC_PREFIX}.admin"
        else:
            topic = f"{KAFKA_TOPIC_PREFIX}.other"

    asyncio.run(stream_events_to_kafka(CONTRACT_ID))
```

## Database Schema for Event Indexing

Example schema for storing indexed events:

```sql
-- Events table
CREATE TABLE mainstay_events (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  event_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  contract_id VARCHAR(56) NOT NULL,
  asset_id BIGINT,
  ledger_sequence BIGINT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  topics JSONB NOT NULL,
  value JSONB NOT NULL,
  indexed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  INDEX idx_asset_id (asset_id),
  INDEX idx_event_type (event_type),
  INDEX idx_created_at (created_at)
);

-- View for maintenance events
CREATE VIEW maintenance_events AS
SELECT 
  asset_id,
  value->>'engineer' as engineer,
  (value->>'timestamp')::BIGINT as service_timestamp,
  value->>'task_type' as task_type,
  (value->>'priority')::INT as priority,
  (value->>'score')::INT as score,
  created_at
FROM mainstay_events
WHERE event_type = 'MAINT';

-- View for ownership transfers
CREATE VIEW transfer_events AS
SELECT 
  asset_id,
  value->>'from' as old_owner,
  value->>'to' as new_owner,
  (value->>'timestamp')::BIGINT as transfer_timestamp,
  created_at
FROM mainstay_events
WHERE event_type = 'XFER';
```

## Filtering and Querying Events

### Find All Maintenance for an Asset

```python
def get_asset_maintenance_history(asset_id, limit=100):
    """Get all maintenance events for an asset."""
    return db.query("""
        SELECT * FROM maintenance_events
        WHERE asset_id = %s
        ORDER BY service_timestamp DESC
        LIMIT %s
    """, (asset_id, limit))
```

### Find Assets Not Serviced in N Days

```python
def find_overdue_assets(days=60):
    """Find assets that haven't been serviced in N days."""
    return db.query("""
        SELECT DISTINCT a.asset_id, 
               MAX(m.service_timestamp) as last_service
        FROM assets a
        LEFT JOIN maintenance_events m ON a.asset_id = m.asset_id
        GROUP BY a.asset_id
        HAVING MAX(m.service_timestamp) < NOW() - INTERVAL %s
    """, (f"{days} days",))
```

### Track Score Trends

```python
def get_score_trend(asset_id, days=30):
    """Get collateral score trend over time."""
    return db.query("""
        SELECT 
          DATE(created_at) as date,
          AVG((value->>'score')::INT) as avg_score,
          MAX((value->>'score')::INT) as max_score,
          MIN((value->>'score')::INT) as min_score,
          COUNT(*) as num_events
        FROM mainstay_events
        WHERE asset_id = %s
          AND event_type = 'MAINT'
          AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL %s
        GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
        ORDER BY date DESC
    """, (asset_id, f"{days} days"))
```

## Alert Examples

Create alerts based on event patterns:

```python
# Alert: Asset not serviced in 60+ days
async def check_overdue_assets():
    overdue = find_overdue_assets(days=60)
    if overdue:
        await send_alert(
            f"⚠️ {len(overdue)} assets are overdue for service",
            slack_channel="#maintenance-alerts"
        )

# Alert: Score dropped significantly in one event
async def check_score_drops(threshold=15):
    drops = db.query("""
        SELECT asset_id, 
               (value->>'old_score')::INT - (value->>'new_score')::INT as drop
        FROM mainstay_events
        WHERE event_type = 'DECAY'
          AND ((value->>'old_score')::INT - (value->>'new_score')::INT) > %s
          AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
    """, (threshold,))
    
    for drop in drops:
        await send_alert(
            f"Score drop detected: Asset {drop['asset_id']} "
            f"dropped {drop['drop']} points"
        )

# Alert: Unauthorized owner transfer attempt
async def check_suspicious_transfers():
    transfers = db.query("""
        SELECT * FROM transfer_events
        WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
          AND new_owner NOT IN (SELECT authorized_owner FROM whitelist)
    """)
    
    if transfers:
        await send_alert(f"Suspicious transfer(s) detected: {len(transfers)}")
```

## Performance Optimization

### Event Batching
```python
# Batch process events instead of one-by-one
def batch_process_events(events, batch_size=100):
    for i in range(0, len(events), batch_size):
        batch = events[i:i+batch_size]
        db.bulk_insert(batch)
        # Commit in batches for better performance
```

### Indexing Strategy
- Index on `asset_id`, `event_type`, `created_at`
- Partition events table by date or asset type
- Archive old events (>1 year) to cold storage

### Caching
```python
# Cache recent asset state to avoid constant DB queries
from functools import lru_cache
import time

cache_ttl = 300  # 5 minutes

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def get_asset_state_cached(asset_id):
    return get_current_asset_state(asset_id)

# Invalidate cache on new events
def invalidate_asset_cache(asset_id):
    get_asset_state_cached.cache_clear()
```
