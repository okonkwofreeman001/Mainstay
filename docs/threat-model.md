# Threat Model & Security Analysis

This document provides a structured threat model for the Mainstay smart contract system using the STRIDE methodology. It is intended to serve as input for security auditors and as a reference for integrators and operators.

---

## System Overview

Mainstay is a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) built on Stellar Soroban. Four smart contracts interact to create a verifiable maintenance audit trail for industrial assets:

1. **Asset Registry** — Canonical registry of industrial assets
2. **Engineer Registry** — Federated credentialing for maintenance engineers
3. **Lifecycle** — Orchestration contract for maintenance records and collateral scoring
4. **Lending** — DeFi lending contract using collateral scores

**Trust Model:** The system assumes the Stellar network validators are honest and the Soroban host environment is secure. Within the application layer, trust is decentralized: asset owners control their assets, trusted issuers verify engineers, and the admin controls configuration. No single party can unilaterally fabricate maintenance history or manipulate collateral scores.

- Can propose asset transfers and deprecation

### TA-2: Rogue Engineer
**Motivation:** Submit fraudulent maintenance records for assets they are not authorized to service; collude with asset owners to fabricate history.
**Capabilities:**
- Holds a valid credential from a trusted issuer
- Can call `submit_maintenance` (but only for assets they are authorized for)
- May attempt to maintain access after credential revocation

### TA-3: Compromised Issuer

**Capabilities:**
- Can update all Lifecycle configuration parameters
- Can pause/unpause contracts
- Can transfer admin role (2-step process)
- Cannot directly forge maintenance records or alter individual asset scores

### TA-5: External Attacker
**Motivation:** Exploit contract vulnerabilities to steal funds, destroy data, or manipulate scores for profit.
**Capabilities:**

- Can call any public function
- May attempt re-entrancy, front-running, or denial-of-service attacks

### TA-6: DeFi Protocol / Lender
**Motivation:** Obtain accurate collateral scores; may attempt to query scores in ways that advantage their lending position.
**Capabilities:**
- Read-only access to all public query functions
- No mutating capabilities

## Cross-Contract Attack Vectors

### CC-01: State Drift Between Contracts
**Description:** Asset is deleted or deprecated in AssetRegistry after Lifecycle has already verified its existence but before the maintenance record is written. This could lead to maintenance records for non-existent assets.

**Risk:** High
**Mitigation:** Cross-contract calls are made atomically within a single transaction. Soroban's transaction model ensures that all contract calls within a transaction succeed or fail together. Note: there are two distinct lifecycle transitions: (1) **Deprecation** (`deprecate_asset`) is owner-only and immediate — this is acceptable because the owner has the right to signal end-of-life and zero out their own collateral score. (2) **Deregistration** (`propose_deregister_asset` → `execute_deregister_asset`) uses a 48-hour timelock, providing a window for detection before permanent removal.

### CC-02: Cross-Contract Re-entrancy
**Description:** Lifecycle calls AssetRegistry and EngineerRegistry. If either were to call back into Lifecycle, state could be manipulated.

**Risk:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Soroban contracts are Wasm-based and isolated. Cross-contract calls execute in the called contract's context. Re-entrancy is limited—the called contract cannot call back into the caller in the same invocation. Lifecycle performs local validation and state writes before external calls.

### CC-03: Registry Address Substitution Attack
**Description:** If the registry binding addresses (`REGISTRY`, `ENG_REG`) can be changed after initialization, a compromised or malicious admin can redirect Lifecycle to attacker-controlled contracts that return forged asset ownership or engineer credential status. Previous versions applied the change immediately on a single admin call with no delay.

**Risk:** Critical
**Mitigation (fixed in #1256):** Registry address changes now follow the same two-step timelocked pattern as all other critical config mutations:
1. Admin calls `propose_update_asset_registry` or `propose_update_engineer_registry` — stores the pending address and starts the 48-hour timelock.
2. After `TIMELOCK_DELAY_SECS` (172,800 seconds) has elapsed, the admin calls `execute_update_asset_registry` or `execute_update_engineer_registry` to apply the change.
3. The legacy single-step `update_asset_registry` / `update_engineer_registry` entry points are now gated: they require an active, unexpired `AST_REG` / `ENG_REG` timelock to be present and consume it when called, preventing any instantaneous registry swap.

**Trust Model for Registry Addresses:**
- The asset registry and engineer registry addresses are set at `initialize` time by the deployer and cannot be changed without a 48-hour window visible to all chain observers.
- The 48-hour window is intentionally longer than Stellar network upgrade cycles, giving integrators and lenders sufficient time to detect and respond to any unexpected registry change.
- Registry address changes emit `PROP_AST` / `PROP_ENG` events (propose) and `REG_AST` / `REG_ENG` events (execute) that monitoring infrastructure should alert on.
- For mainnet deployments, the admin should be a multisig account so no single key can unilaterally schedule a registry swap.
- Operators running production deployments should subscribe to `ADM_AUD` events and treat any `PROP_AST` or `PROP_ENG` event as a critical alert requiring manual review before the 48-hour window expires.

### CC-04: Stale Data from Read-Only Cross-Contract Calls
**Description:** Lifecycle reads asset data from AssetRegistry. If AssetRegistry's TTL has expired and data is stale, Lifecycle could operate on incorrect data.

**Risk:** High
**Mitigation:** Both contracts extend TTL on every write. `get_collateral_score` calls `try_get_asset` which panics if the asset doesn't exist. Soroban's storage model ensures reads return the latest written value or nothing.

---

## Storage & TTL Threats

### ST-01: Silent Persistent Storage Expiry
Persistent storage entries expire silently after TTL. Without explicit extension, any stored data can be lost. This affects all four contracts.

**Affected data:** Asset records, maintenance history, engineer credentials, collateral scores, loan records, configuration.

**Mitigation:** Every `put`/`set` call in all contracts is followed by `extend_ttl(THRESHOLD, TARGET)` where `THRESHOLD = TARGET = 518,400` ledgers (~30 days).

**Verification:** See `docs/ttl-strategy.md` for the complete key-to-extension mapping.

### ST-02: Instance Storage Expiry
Instance storage holds critical configuration: admin address, trusted issuer list, registry bindings. If it expires, admin operations and cross-contract bindings panic with `NotInitialized`.

**Mitigation:** All admin-mutating functions call `env.storage().instance().extend_ttl(518400, 518400)`.

### ST-03: Pause Flag Expiry (Issue #756)
The pause flag is stored in persistent storage. If it expires while the contract is paused, the `unwrap_or(false)` default returns `false`, silently unpausing the contract.

**Mitigation:** `pause()` and `unpause()` explicitly extend TTL on the `PAUSED` key. All four contracts implement this.

---

## Deployment & Initialization Threats

### DI-01: Uninitialized Contract Exploitation
Between deployment and `initialize_admin`/`initialize`, anyone could call uninitialized functions.

**Mitigation:** All functions check initialization state and panic with `NotInitialized` if called before setup. Deploy + initialize must be done in the same transaction block.

### DI-02: Admin Key Compromise During Deployment
The deployer key is the most critical key during deployment. If compromised, the attacker can set themselves as admin.

**Mitigation:** Use a cold wallet for deployment; transfer admin to a multisig account after initialization. Store deployer key in a hardware wallet or secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault).

### DI-03: Admin Key Compromise + Contract Upgrade Attack
**Description:** All four contracts (Asset Registry, Engineer Registry, Lifecycle, Lending) expose admin-gated `propose_upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)` / `execute_upgrade(admin)` functions that swap the contract's WASM code entirely. If a **single** admin key is compromised — via phishing, a leaked signer, a malicious dependency in a signing tool, or physical key theft — the attacker can propose an upgrade to arbitrary malicious WASM. Because contract logic is Turing-complete, a successful upgrade attack is total: the attacker could drain lending vaults, forge collateral scores, fabricate credentials, or remove all remaining access controls in one shot. This is qualitatively worse than any single-function exploit in the STRIDE tables above, because it replaces the rules those tables assume.

**Risk:** Critical

**Mitigation — Multisig Admin Quorum (primary defense):**
Production deployments should never run with a single admin key holding unilateral upgrade power. `set_admin_quorum(admin, new_admins, threshold)` converts the contract from single-admin mode to **M-of-N quorum mode**: once `admin_threshold > 1`, `require_quorum()` collects authorization from distinct admin addresses (deduplicated so one compromised signer cannot cast multiple votes) and blocks any admin-gated call — including `propose_upgrade`/`execute_upgrade` — until the threshold is met. A single compromised key is therefore insufficient to propose or execute an upgrade on its own; the attacker would need to separately compromise `threshold` independent keys, ideally held by different people/organizations/hardware wallets. See the runbook's [key management section](deployment-runbook.md#66-key-management-differences) for mainnet key custody guidance, and configure quorum immediately after initialization — see [DI-02](#di-02-admin-key-compromise-during-deployment) for the same principle applied to the deployer key itself.

**Mitigation — Upgrade Timelock (defense in depth):**
Even with quorum configured, upgrades are not instantaneous. `propose_upgrade` only records an intended `new_wasm_hash`; `execute_upgrade` is rejected until the configured timelock delay has elapsed (mirroring the 48-hour pattern used for asset deregistration in [CC-01](#cc-01-state-drift-between-contracts)). This delay exists specifically so that a malicious or erroneous upgrade proposal is **visible on-chain before it can take effect** — monitoring the `UPGRADE` event (emitted on both propose and execute, per [Section 5.1](deployment-runbook.md#51-event-monitoring) of the runbook) gives operators, auditors, and the community a window to detect an unauthorized proposal and respond (e.g., rally remaining quorum signers to avoid reaching threshold, or coordinate an off-chain response) before the malicious code goes live. The timelock does not prevent an attacker who already controls full quorum, but it removes the possibility of an instant, undetected upgrade — the two mitigations are complementary, not redundant: quorum raises the bar to *execute* an upgrade at all, and the timelock ensures that even a successful proposal is not silent.

**Residual risk:** If an attacker compromises `threshold` or more admin keys simultaneously (e.g. all keys custodied by the same operator, or a coordinated multi-party attack), both mitigations are bypassed. Operators should ensure quorum signers are held by genuinely independent parties/devices, not merely different key files on the same machine.

### DI-04: Testnet → Mainnet Configuration Drift
Testnet configuration accidentally carried to mainnet (wrong admin, wrong thresholds).

**Mitigation:** `scripts/deploy_testnet.sh` hard-rejects non-testnet networks. Mainnet deployment is manual with `--network mainnet`.

---

## Economic & Game-Theoretic Threats

### EG-01: Score Inflation via Fake Maintenance
**Description:** Asset owner colludes with a credentialed engineer to submit fictitious maintenance records, inflating the collateral score.

**Risk:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Engineer credentialing creates accountability. Issuers vet engineers. Repeated fraud by an engineer leads to credential revocation, destroying their on-chain reputation. The `reputation_score` in EngineerRegistry further weights score increments; low-reputation engineers contribute less to collateral scores.

### EG-02: Decay Avoidance via Minimal Maintenance
**Description:** Asset owner submits minimal maintenance at exactly the decay interval to maintain the score without real upkeep.

**Risk:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Task weights differentiate minor maintenance (2 pts) from major overhauls (10 pts). Small tasks cannot offset decay indefinitely. The recency-weighted dual-model scoring penalizes assets with only old, minor records.

### EG-03: Lending Contract Griefing
**Description:** Attacker vouches for a borrower with a tiny stake, knowing the borrower will default, just to consume storage and compute resources.

**Risk:** Low
**Mitigation:** `min_stake` configuration prevents trivial vouches. Transaction fees make this uneconomical at scale.

### EG-04: Slash Balance Manipulation
**Description:** Admin could set `slash_bps` to 100% (10,000 BPS) to slash the full voucher stake on any default, even for minor defaults.

**Risk:** Low (admin is trusted)
**Mitigation:** Admin is a trusted role. Configuration changes emit events. For mainnet, admin should be a multisig account, making unilateral config changes impossible.

## Audit Focus Areas

Based on this threat model, auditors should prioritize:

1. **TTL extension coverage** — Verify every `put`/`set` has a corresponding `extend_ttl` (see SOR-01, SOR-02 in `audit-report.md`)
2. **Cross-contract authorization** — Verify Lifecycle correctly checks both AssetRegistry and EngineerRegistry before accepting maintenance (see CC-01, T-LC-11, T-LC-12)
3. **Access control completeness** — Verify all admin, owner, issuer, and engineer functions require proper authorization (see T-AR-08, T-ER-01, T-LC-01)
4. **Arithmetic safety** — Verify score calculations, decay computations, and BPS math use checked/saturating operations (see SOR-06)
5. **State machine validation** — Verify credential lifecycle (Valid → GracePeriod → HardExpired) and asset lifecycle (Active → Deprecated → Decommissioned) are correctly enforced (see SOR-10)
6. **Deployment security** — Verify initialization is front-run resistant and deployment runbook is followed (see DI-01, DI-02)
7. **Pause mechanism integrity** — Verify pause flags cannot silently expire (see ST-03, SOR-02)
