**Snapshot includes:**
- Asset metadata (id, type, serial number, owner)
- Ownership and registration timestamps
- Deprecation status
- Collateral status (locked, lender, loan_id)
- Current collateral score
- Collateral valuation
- Maintenance history summary
- Last service timestamp
- Snapshot timestamp

**Benefits:**
- Single atomic call to get complete asset state

## Issue #1311: Maintenance Compliance Standard Registry

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**What was implemented:**
- Comprehensive documentation for compliance standard registry (900+ lines)
- Enhanced test suite with 14 comprehensive test cases
- Clear integration patterns and best practices

**Documentation:** `docs/MAINTENANCE_COMPLIANCE.md`

**Smart Contract Functions (Already Implemented):**
1. `register_standard()` - Register maintenance standard for asset type
2. `validate_maintenance_compliance()` - Validate maintenance against standard
3. `get_maintenance_standard()` - Retrieve standard for asset type

**New Test Suite:** `tests/test_issues_1311_maintenance_compliance.rs`

**Test Coverage:**
- Standard registration success/failure scenarios
- Compliance validation with matching/mismatched proofs
- Multiple asset types and task types
- Binary data validation
- Event emission verification
- Edge cases (empty data, large standards, multiple assets)

**Documentation Includes:**
- Core concepts explanation
- Implementation patterns:
  - Offline standard definition with on-chain verification
  - DeFi lending protocol integration
  - Audit trail and compliance reporting
- Integration examples (TypeScript, Python, Rust)
- Best practices and migration strategy
- Troubleshooting guide

**Benefits:**
- Define and enforce maintenance standards per asset type
- Enable DeFi compliance validation
- Support regulatory audits
- Integrate with lending protocols

## Operator Guide: Getting Started

### 1. Monitor Collateral Scores (Issue #1309)
```bash
./scripts/monitoring/prometheus-exporter.sh
# Access metrics at http://localhost:9600/metrics
```

### 2. Index Events in Real-Time (Issue #1308)
```python
# Use the patterns in docs/EVENT_INDEXER.md
python3 event_listener.py  # Minimal example
```

### 3. Backup Assets (Issue #1310)
```rust
let snapshot = lifecycle.get_asset_full_snapshot(&asset_id);
// Store snapshot off-chain for recovery
```

### 4. Enforce Compliance Standards (Issue #1311)
```rust
// Register standard
lifecycle.register_standard(&admin, &symbol_short!("ENGINE"), &standard_hash);

// Validate compliance
let is_compliant = lifecycle.validate_maintenance_compliance(
    &asset_id,
    &task_type,
    &proof_hash
);
```

## Performance Metrics

| Feature | Complexity | Performance | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Event Indexing | O(n) | Varies by indexing strategy | Recommend batching for 500+ events |
| Prometheus Metrics | O(n) | ~60s per scrape | Increase interval for 500+ assets |
| Asset Snapshot | O(1) | Single contract call | Atomic read, minimal gas |
| Compliance Validation | O(1) | Constant time | Hash comparison only |
