## [Unreleased]

- Added invoice cost reconciliation, task grouping, maintenance dispute resolution,
  and hash-based maintenance evidence attachments to the lifecycle contract.

### Added
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`: required-reviewer rules gate all PRs touching `contracts/`, CI workflows, `SECURITY.md`, and the threat-model doc (closes [#781](https://github.com/TwinTrustMainstay/Mainstay/issues/781))
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: documented branch-protection requirements (1 approval + passing CI, no force-push) and the CODEOWNERS review expectation for `contracts/` (closes [#781](https://github.com/TwinTrustMainstay/Mainstay/issues/781))
- `test_cross_owner_duplicate_serial_rejected` in `asset-registry`: verifies that the global serial-number dedup key blocks a second owner from registering the same physical machine (closes [#782](https://github.com/TwinTrustMainstay/Mainstay/issues/782))
- `test_decay_score_never_drops_to_zero_with_history` in `lifecycle`: verifies that calling `decay_score` on an asset with maintenance records never stores or returns 0 (closes [#784](https://github.com/TwinTrustMainstay/Mainstay/issues/784))
- `ContractError` (`lifecycle/src/errors.rs`) variants added since 1.0.0: `ScoreOverflow` (19), `NotesTooLong` (20), `ScoreFrozen` (21), `AssetDecommissioned` (22), `BatchTooLarge` (23), `InsufficientSigners` (24), `Reentrancy` (25), `DuplicateAdmin` (26), `SnapshotNotFound` (27), `InsufficientPredictionData` (28), `WeightProposalAlreadyExists` (29), `SpecializationMismatch` (30), `RecurringTaskNotFound` (31), `RecurringTaskInactive` (32), `DuplicateRecurringTask` (33), `InvalidRecurringSchedule` (34), `DuplicateRecordNotFound` (35), `StandardAlreadyRegistered` (36), `RateLimitExceeded` (37), `BatchRevokeTooLarge` (38)
- `Config` (`lifecycle/src/types.rs`) fields added since 1.0.0: `admins` and `admin_threshold` (multisig admin quorum), `max_engineer_history` (per-engineer history cap), `min_collateral_score`, `max_notes_length`, `task_weights`, `max_submissions_per_hour` (engineer rate limiting)
- Storage keys (`lifecycle/src/storage.rs`) added since 1.0.0: `SCHIST` (score history), `LUPD` (last score update timestamp), `FROZEN` / `FRZ_SCR` (decommission freeze flag and frozen score), `HLTH_SNP` (health snapshots), `XFER_HIST` (ownership transfer history), `ENG_HIST` / `ENG_AUTH` (per-engineer history and per-asset authorization), `SUB_WIN` (rolling-hour submission rate window), `RVK_TL` / `TL_PROP` (timelocked engineer-revocation and generic admin proposals), `MSTD` / `SCR_WGT` (per-asset-type maintenance standards and scoring weights)

### Fixed
- `apply_decay` in `lifecycle/src/scoring.rs`: enforce `MIN_SCORE_WITH_HISTORY = 1` in both the main decay path and the early-return path so the stored score is never written as 0 for an asset that has at least one maintenance record (closes [#784](https://github.com/TwinTrustMainstay/Mainstay/issues/784))
- `get_maintenance_history_page` in `lifecycle`: cap the caller-supplied `limit` at `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` (100) so a large `limit` can no longer reintroduce an unbounded, potentially oversized response (closes [#1075](https://github.com/TwinTrustMainstay/Mainstay/issues/1075))
- `HealthSnapshot` in `lifecycle`: renamed the `timestamp` field to `snapshot_timestamp` to make explicit that it records when the snapshot was captured (closes [#1076](https://github.com/TwinTrustMainstay/Mainstay/issues/1076))

### Security
- `initialize_admin` in `asset-registry` already required `deployer.require_auth()`, preventing front-run attacks; the existing `test_initialize_admin_rejects_non_deployer` test and deployment-runbook section 3 now explicitly document this protection (closes [#783](https://github.com/TwinTrustMainstay/Mainstay/issues/783))
